Python Program to Grab Stored Wifi Passwords on Windows

Made this after looking around and not being able to find anything that fits my needs.

Have elderly father in law who we got a tablet for so we can Skype. He doesn't know his wifi name or password and not very good with his computer. Made this so we can just email it to him and he can read us what is says so we can set up his tablet before it gets to him.

Thought about adding in some twilio or email to just send it but had to make this quick so we could send out his tablet. 

Used pyinstaller to make it send email it to him. Worked good so far.
